1. Fork the repo to your own Github
2. Add your partner as a collaborator or have your partner add you respectively
3. Clone the repo to a chosen directory on your computer
4. You can now edit and run the programs. Compile the program by typing "scalac *.scala"
5. Run the program by typing "scala start". You should receive an error message telling you to unclog the system, we will do this by editing one of the .scala files.
6. Let either you or your partner edit the file titled "plunger.scala" and change the word "false" to "true"
7. Recompiling the program and running it should now successfully decrypt the message although you won't be granted access to it yet.
8. Try pushing your changes to the github repo. The order of commands are: "git add .", "git commit -m "[some message]"", "git push origin master"
(Remember you can use "git status" to check the status of your repo at any time)
9. Have your partner fetch the changes to their computer by typing "git pull origin master".
10. For the next part both you and your partner should edit the file "crypt2.scala", each person changes one of the zeros to the value 21.
11. Push your edits and pull, then resolve the resulting merge conflict
12. For the last part have the person who didn't get to edit in step 6 go in and edit "crypt1.scala", specifically change the value of key in "val key = 0" to 61
13. Recompiling and running the program should now give you the correct decrypted message!
